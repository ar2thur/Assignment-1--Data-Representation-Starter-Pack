# CS 3503 Assignment 1 - Number Base Conversion

## Author
[William Rose]

## Description
My implementation of Owl Tech ’s number base conversion utility .

## Build Instructions
‘‘‘bash
gcc -o convert convert .c main .c
./ convert


The debugger I use stopped working, let me know if you have any issues with yours, I used the command .\main.exe to run it in the terminal rather than VS Code.
‘‘‘


## Test Results
[Summary: 91/100 tests passed]

## Notes
As a second year student at KSU this assignment was definitely a grind for me. This is the first C program I have ever created, and it was rough. I am glad I made it through, not with full marks, but I am proud it works pretty well.
